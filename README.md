# Iris Flower Classification - Machine Learning Project

This project involves building a classification model to identify Iris flowers into three species using petal and sepal length/width features. The project includes data preprocessing, model training with Random Forest, and deployment of a prediction script.

---

## 🌸 Objective
- Build a classification model to identify Iris flower species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica).
- Identify the most significant features influencing classification.
- Evaluate model performance using appropriate techniques.

## ⚙️ Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
https://github.com/SaiRudresh/Iris-Flower-Classification.git
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
---

## 🚀 Running the Code
### 1. Train the Model
```bash
python iris_classification.py
```
This will create `iris_rf_model.pkl` and `iris_scaler.pkl`.

### 2. Run Prediction Script
```bash
python predict_iris.py
```
Modify the `new_data` in `predict_iris.py` with new input measurements to predict species.

## 📊 Model Evaluation
- **Accuracy:** High accuracy achieved through Random Forest.
- **Feature Importance:** Petal length and petal width are most significant.

---

## 📊 Dataset Description
The dataset includes the following features:
- **Sepal length (cm)**
- **Sepal width (cm)**
- **Petal length (cm)**
- **Petal width (cm)**

The dataset used is the **Iris dataset** from `sklearn.datasets`.

---

## 🎯 Feature Importance
Based on the trained model, the most significant features for classification are:
- **Petal length (cm)**
- **Petal width (cm)**

Feature importance was extracted using `model.feature_importances_`.
